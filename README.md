## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project aims to help stakeholders and EV enthusiasts understand the **charging patterns**, **battery range trends**, and **vehicle performance** through insightful Tableau dashboards. The dataset used includes parameters such as:

- Vehicle ID
- Charging cycles
- Battery State of Charge (SoC)
- Estimated Range
- Energy Consumption
- Time & Distance

The visualizations allow users to interact with EV data, monitor trends, and analyze operational efficiency.
